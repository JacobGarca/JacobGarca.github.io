    <h2>Blown to Bits reflection</h2>
    <p>I believe that computing is transforming society. Privacy is getting less private since nothing is able to be deleted. Info is able to be leaked so much easier now than before Encryptions, while innovating buisnesses, is helping crime and terrorism
    . Machines could make mistakes and wrongly copyright people for something different. Privacy is getting less private since nothing is able to be deleted. Digital documents can easily be changed or reversed. We no longer need things like dictionaries since everything could be looked up.
     We all leave digital footprints and nothing secret, employers can look up our entire record and everything we've done on the internent.</p>

    <h3>Light Bot Reflection</h3>
    <p>The light bot is a lot like a computer. The light bot and a computer both utilize states, which can be manipulated with inputs to give you different outputs and change the state
    . They will not do anything you don't tell them to do. The light bot is different from a computer in a lot of ways however. While they are both state machines, a computer is a lot more complex
    . Light bot could utilize proc 1/2, while a computer utilizes thousands of procs, all working together in infinite combinations. Another difference is that light bot was limited to five actions, while a computer has virtually no limits.</p>

    <h4>1.1.3 Conclusion Questions</h4>
    <p>1. Its a good idea to test out small pieces of code so when something inevitably goes wrong, its much easier to troubleshoot because there's less code to shift through.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Other task that require multiple tries is things like math, Architecture, and designing inventions and innovations. They all involve a trial and error component, however these are not digital, they are for the most part physical.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. The reason a dual core processor seems faster is because it splits the programs between them and splits the instructions between that, so they end up jumping back and forth on several instructions.</p>
