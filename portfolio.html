    <h0.75>I believe that computing is transforming society.</h0.75>

    <h0.75>Privacy is getting less private since nothing is able to be deleted.</h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>Info is able to be leaked so much easier now than before</h0.75>
    <br>
    <h0.75>Encryptions, while innovating buisnesses, is helping crime and terrorism.</h0.75>
    <br>
    <h0.75>Machines could make mistakes and wrongly copyright people for something different</h0.75>

    <h0.75>Privacy is getting less private since nothing is able to be deleted.</h0.75>
    <br>
    <h0.75>Digital documents can easily be changed or reversed.</h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>We no longer need things like dictionaries since everything could be looked up.</h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>We all leave digital footprints and nothing secret, employers can look up our</h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>entire record and everything we've done on the internent.</h0.75>

    <h0.75>The light bot is a lot like a computer.</h0.75>
    <br>
    <h0.75>The light bot and a computer both utilize states, which</h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>can be manipulated with inputs to give you different outputs</h0.75>
    <br>
    <h0.75>and change the state. They will not do anything you don't</h0.75>
    <br>
    <h0.75>tell them to do. The light bot is different from a computer in a lot</h0.75>
    <br>
    <h0.75>of ways however. While they are both state machines, a computer is a lot</h0.75>
    <br>
    <h0.75>more complex. Light bot could utilize proc 1/2, while a computer utilizes</h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>thousands of procs, all working together in infinite combinations. Another</h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>difference is that light bot was limited to five actions, while a computer has</h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>virtually no limits.</h0.75>
