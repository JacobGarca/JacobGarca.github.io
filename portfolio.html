    <h2>Blown to Bits reflection</h2>
    <p>I believe that computing is transforming society. Privacy is getting less private since nothing is able to be deleted. Info is able to be leaked so much easier now than before Encryptions,
    while innovating businesses, is helping crime and terrorism . Machines could make mistakes and wrongly copyright people for something different.
    Privacy is getting less private since nothing is able to be deleted. Digital documents can easily be changed or reversed. We no longer need things like dictionaries since everything could be looked up.
    We all leave digital footprints and nothing secret, employers can look up our entire record and everything we've done on the internet.</p>

    <h4>1.1.3 Conclusion Questions</h4>
    <p>1. Its a good idea to test out small pieces of code so when something inevitably goes wrong, its much easier to troubleshoot because there's less code to shift through.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Other task that require multiple tries is things like math, Architecture, and designing inventions and innovations. They all involve a trial and error component, however these are not digital, they are for the most part physical.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. The reason a dual core processor seems faster is because it splits the programs between them and splits the instructions between that, so they end up jumping back and forth on several instructions.</p>

    <h5>1.1.4 Conclusion Questions</h5>
    <p>1. It makes it simpiler to setup and debug easier without risking breaking something else.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. An event is the input like a button or such, the handler is the result or outcome</p>
    <br>
    <p>3a. Some details of the handler is when the sax button is pressed, it plays the sax.</p>
    <br>
    <p>b. Some details that would be useful to expose is what button does what, or what sound is played with what button, or what sprite is affected by an input.</p>

    <br>
    <h5>1.1.5 Conclusion Questions</h5>
    <p>1. The advantage of using a fixed variable is that it is much easier to change and has less chance to be buggy/break.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. An example would be the last time the temperature was modified.</p>
    <br>
    <pre>
    get temperature
    forever
      temperature=getCurrentTemperature
      wait 24 hours
    </pre>
    <br>
    <p>3a. Two examples of software that uses a accumulator is the folders file that shows how much memory has been used on a drive and and phones call log.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3b. A phone log is an accumulator because it counts the amount of minutes, seconds, etc, that you've been in a single call and a accumulater only records the total of one thing, like this.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. The difference between the accumulater and the aggregator roles is that the accumulater counts the total but doesn't know each individual ammount where the aggregator knows the individual amounts but not the total.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p> Our program asks you quiz questions and ends when you get all the questions correct. It sets the flag "finished" to false and the accumulator to 0. After you get 3 correct, it sets the flag to true. It is a flag because it uses the boolean true or false. It is set to false at the start and when variable correctAnswer=3, it sets the flag to false.</p>

    <br>
    <p>The programming language used in our game is scratch. The purpose of our program is A sidescrolling puzzle/action game to Entertain. We have a karma system that affects the ending you receive based on your actions in the game. The goal of it is to get Bobbery outside the dungeon using any means; You will reach one of the two endings, the bad one with all of the guards, or the good one with the expensive gem. It offers multiple ways of play, one with killing and one without. Our video shows how the karma system works in-game. If you were to kill the guard, it will add one to the karma value, thus sealing your bad ending. However that value won't change if you click the left-most door, which takes you to the good ending since the value never rose. If the guard died and you click the door, nothing would happen.

    <h3>Light Bot Reflection</h3>
    <p>The light bot is a lot like a computer. The light bot and a computer both utilize states, which can be manipulated with inputs to give you different outputs and change the state
    . They will not do anything you don't tell them to do. The light bot is different from a computer in a lot of ways however. While they are both state machines, a computer is a lot more complex
    . Light bot could utilize proc 1/2, while a computer utilizes thousands of procs, all working together in infinite combinations. Another difference is that light bot was limited to five actions, while a computer has virtually no limits.</p>

    <h5>1.1.6 Conclusion Questions</h5>
    <br>
    <p>1. A stepper is the amount of times something is being executed, a walker refers to numbers in a sequence, and a best so far shows the best number for the constraint. </p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Something i've used that uses a best so far is a arcade machine scoreboard.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>1.2.2 Conlusion Questions</h5>
    <br>
    <p>1. Both scratch and Appinventor use block programming. The things scratch doesn’t show is the binary that the block code translates to.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Pre-Write: Mobile devices are much more common than computers, much more ease of access. Mobile more appealing to some people. Phones are getting cheaper. Programmings getting simpler. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>2. With mobile devices becoming more prevalent and easier to obtain (price, quantity, etc), people will be more inclined to learn and make programs for mobile devices. Society will slowly creep towards a technological one where people will be more focused on electronics than other things.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>1.2.3 Conclusion Question</h5>
    <br>
    <p>1. Both scratch and appinventor use block programming, but appinventor has more tools at your disposal, such as accelerometer, and doesn’t code ON the sprites.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. On a phone app, you have gyros and touch. On computer, you have a mouse.</p>
